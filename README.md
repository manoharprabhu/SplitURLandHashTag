SplitURLandHashTag
==================

A Java class that reads a dictionary file and takes twitter hashtags and URL for input and split them into meaningful sentence.

Currently, it is a very basic algorithm that scans the word from right to left and greedily picks the words as it finds one. Not guaranteed to find a meaningful sentence every time.
